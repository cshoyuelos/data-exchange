xtomo: Data Exchange for X-ray Tomography
=========================================
xtomo is a Python toolbox for reading tomographic raw datasets collected at different synchrotron facilities and writing them as Data Exchange files (http://www.aps.anl.gov/DataExchange/). 

xtomo also provides an interface between tomographic raw datasets and tomoPy (https://github.com/tomopy/), a Python toolbox to perform tomographic data processing and image reconstruction tasks developed at the Advanced Photon Source (http://www.aps.anl.gov/).
